This is the distribution package for cascadilla.cls, a LaTeX document class for
typesetting documents that conform to the Cascadilla Proceedings Project
stylesheet, used by various linguistics conference proceedings (such as WCCFL).
Also included are an example document (example.tex and example.pdf), a BibTeX
bibliography style (cascadilla.bst) and a BibTeX database used by the example
document (exampleref.bib).

This package was written by Max Bane, copyright 2008-2011, and is maintained by
the same. It is distributed under the conditions of the LaTeX Project Public
License, a copy of which is included in LICENSE.txt; the license boilerplate is
also included at the top of each source file.

The reference stylesheet that this document class aims to implement is described
by the Cascadilla Proceedings Project at the following location:
http://www.lingref.com/cpp/authors/style.html

The style is occasionally updated by Cascadilla; if you find that this document
class no longer implements the stylesheet correctly, or if you discover any
bugs, please contact Max Bane at max.bane@gmail.com.

As of version 1.7, you may now also report and view bugs, check out the latest
source code, or even contribute your own changes to the source code, at the
github project page for this project:
https://github.com/maxbane/cascadilla.cls

Special thanks to Jonathan Brindle for helping to resolve some glitches in
previous versions. Thanks also to Christopher Pi침칩n for spotting a
difficult-to-detect layout error, and suggesting a solution.

TO USE:

Simply place cascadilla.cls and cascadilla.bst in the same directory as the
paper you are writing, and use "\documentclass{cascadilla}" instead of
"\documentclass{article}". See the example paper (example.tex) for more details
of usage.

To make cascadilla.cls and cascadilla.bst available for all of your papers,
without having to put separate copies in the directory of each, consult your
LaTeX distribution's documentation to find out where to place them so that they
are globally available. This is usually somewhere in your "texmf" tree.
